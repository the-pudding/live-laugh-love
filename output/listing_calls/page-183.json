For reference, my wrist is 6 1\/4&quot; and I am wearing a size medium  in the photo.  That said, I like my cuffs tighter so I would order a size small.\n\n\u2665  This item arrives in a gift box with signed logo tag; perfect for giving!\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOther bracelets shown available by request.\n\nCreate a Custom Bracelet here:  http:\/\/etsy.me\/2bU7H4X\n\nSee Cuffs and Personalized Bangles here:  http:\/\/etsy.me\/2cHlmlO\n\nChain and Beaded Bracelets can be found here:  http:\/\/etsy.me\/2c6l1Fr\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nNOTE -  If you re-shape  the bracelet to your wrist,  it cannot be returned.  To learn how to put on a cuff bracelet to avoid bending, please read the following:\n\n\nAbout cuffs . . . \n\nSome people like a tighter fit and some like a looser fit.  But whatever your preference, never bend open a cuff to put it on.  If you open and then squeeze the cuff every  time you put it on or take it off, you will weaken the metal and eventually it will break apart.  \n\nSo, how do I put it on?  There is a &quot;soft spot&quot; where the wrist can be squeezed to about  1&quot; thick.  Holding the cuff like a &quot;C&quot; perpendicular to your wrist, push the bottom of the &quot;C&quot; into the soft spot and roll your wrist into the cuff.  To take the bracelet off, just do the reverse.  If you are still not sure, there are many videos on the internet about &quot;how to put on a cuff bracelet&quot;.\n\nTo see all my jewelry, enter my shop here:  * * *    http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/queeniejewels    * * *\n\nThanks!\n***********************************************\n***********************************************\n\nWe are living in difficult times but you do not have to be afraid or panic.

Great for any room decorating idea to incorporate a little bit of your newly found culture.  Great for hanging over the Hawaii trip photos!\n\nEach one of your signs are made to order in our family shop in Madison Indiana. After you order we will take your personal order and cut it out of a sheet of metal and then grind and prepare it for painting. We then put a super tough powdercoat paint on it and bake it in our oven So that you have the most durable and outdoor or indoor duty sign available. We are a veteran owned and operated family business so we care about you and your order and want you to love it! We love what we do, our product and our customers. \n\nThere are a different options for hanging your sign: \n1.  Use hanging putty tack strips (we use the 3M brand) they are inexpensive and it does not leave any frontward marks on your sign.\n2. Use double sided tape.  Just like the hanging putty it is great because it doesn&#39;t leave any marks on the front of the sign and gives it a little depth\n3. Request to have holes put in your sign and we will drill 1\/8&quot; holes in your sign and provide you with 2 nails for your wall at no charge! :-)\nYou can also read about our hanging instruction in our FAQ and we send hanging instruction with each sign.\n\n\nAll signs are finished in a super tough outdoor duty powdercoat paint in a variety of colors (unless requested bare metal).  What is powder coat you ask?  In a nutshell, it is just the toughest paint available - For more about this see our FAQ about paint. \n\nAll Signs are made to order, but it should not take more than 1-2weeks.\nPlease contact me if you have questions \u2013 We are happy to help you\n\n\n\nWe do custom orders - just message us and we will work with you on your sign.\n\nAll of our products are made to order in Indiana and is proudly veteran owned!","creation_tsz":1614127125,"ending_tsz":1624491525,"original_creation_tsz":1581170123,"last_modified_tsz":1614127125,"price":"65.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":97,"sku":[],"tags":["Home Decor","metal wall art","Metal word sign","Love you more","Anniversary Gift","Love wall art","Birthday Gift","Family Room Decor","Wedding Gift","Live Laugh Aloha","Hawaiian Decor","Beach Decor","Word Art"],"materials":["All American Quality Steel","Tough outdoor quality powdercoat paint"],"shop_section_id":25556934,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1581170123,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/777132649\/live-laugh-aloha-metal-wall-sign?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":285,"num_favorers":19,"shipping_template_id":85236171223,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"64","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"13","item_width":"7","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1029,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":279932402,"state":"active","user_id":12749197,"category_id":null,"title":"Ralph Waldo Emerson Quote - This is to have succeeded - Original Archival Print on Matte Finish Paper - 8x10, 11x14, 16x20, 20x24, 24x30","description":"&quot;To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.

My aluminum jewelry is shiny and sturdy. Its an affordable alternative to sterling silver thats very comfortable and looks great!\n\nHand Stamping side note : Please remember that Hand stamping is not perfect \u2013 each piece that is created has it\u2019s own individuality and uniqueness \u2013 no two pieces will ever be the same! All items are created with love by my own two hands especially for you. The process of hand stamping produces a unique rustic impression that is not perfect, and should not be considered a flaw; letters will not be perfectly aligned or spaced and pendants that are layered may rub from wear over time; this is considered a distinctive character that hand stamped jewellery is recognised for.\n\nHand Stamping side note : Please remember that Hand stamping is not perfect \u2013 each piece that is created has it\u2019s own individuality and uniqueness \u2013 no two pieces will ever be the same!
