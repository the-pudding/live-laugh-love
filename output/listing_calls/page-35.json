This Live Love Laugh, Load Aim Fire design is available in any of the colors shown on the color swatch photos. If you require multiple colors, or a size not listed please contact me through Etsy messages or our customer service email: ditchthestitchdesigns @ gmail . com\n\nYou will choose the height and the width will be proportionate. If you need it to meet specific dimensions please contact me.\n\nThese decals are perfect for automobiles, automobile windows, coolers, mailboxes, water bottles, laptops, hard hats, sports helmets, planners, notebooks and more. They are very durable and weather resistant. They will basically last until you remove them (under normal conditions). The decals will adhere to nearly any solid non-porous surface. Acceptable surfaces include finished wood, plastic, walls (smooth, painted), car bodies, car windows, metal, glass, acrylic, etc. Unacceptable surfaces that won&#39;t pair well with the vinyl and adhesive include clothing, fabric, skin, bumpy plastic, bumpy drywall, or any porous\/soft surface.\n\nThese are die-cut vinyl, meaning the sticker will be what you see in black. There is no &quot;background&quot;, and no &quot;printing&quot; involved. They are applied using a masking tape-like material called &quot;transfer tape&quot;. It is applied over every decal, and helps you lift and apply the entire decal in one step, rather than applying each piece individually. The process is very easy, and I include application instructions with every single order.\n\nBe sure to follow the included application instructions (mailed with your order).\n\nAdditional info:\n\n-If no color is selected, you may be mailed a random color. If you do not send your details at the time of checkout, I will try my best to reach you but cannot hold your order longer than 1 week. It is your responsibility to monitor messages, orders, etc. Please be prompt and courteous in the instance I have a question regarding your order.\n\n- PLEASE FOLLOW ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS! \n-Only messages sent to us through Etsy or our customer service email (ditchthestitchdesigns @ gmail.com) are monitored and responded to. \n-If I&#39;ve made a mistake with your order, please let me know and I will rectify the situation immediately!\n\nDecals ship free in the United States. Free shipping is untracked. \n\nFor international purchases of decals, please contact me.\nIF YOU ARE INTERNATIONAL AND CHOOSE A DOMESTIC SHIPPING RATE, YOUR ORDER WILL BE CANCELLED AND REFUNDED.\n\nTerms of Sale:\n\n-All sales are final. Returns, exchanges, refunds and\/or cancellations are not accepted for buyer-end errors (failing to read the listing, forgetting to include a color or font choice (if applicable), etc.).\n\n-&quot;The decals don&#39;t work&quot;, &quot;the decals don&#39;t stick&quot;, &quot;the decals are ugly&quot; and other cosmetic\/application based arguments are not valid basis for a return. They work. I personally use my own decals as well as many local people to me. They are all made from the same brand and make of material, consistently ordered from the same supplier. If there is any error in how they apply\/stick, it is not from any kind of error on my end (unless 200 customers reach out with the same claim of them not sticking- then it may be attributed to a faulty roll of vinyl, transfer tape, etc.). I apply these decals both large and small on a regular basis. The glue\/adhesive is the same on every single decal, and if something were faulty, I would be the very first person to notice (and correct it). I provide application instructions, so if you follow them (both in pre-cleaning and application), I can assure you they will &quot;work&quot; wonderfully. If you do not follow these instructions, your decals will not &quot;work&quot;!\n\n**Returns are ONLY accepted in the instance that I make an error, which is very rare, because the text will be copy and pasted directly out of the message to assure correct spelling\/capitalization. In the instance of an error claim, I will open the cut file from your order date and cross reference it with your order details. If it was my error, you will be sent remakes. If it was your error, you must either reorder or use them as-is. I have no use whatsoever for decals which were already made to your standards that you decided you no longer want. I cannot &#39;reuse&#39; them. There are no exceptions whatsoever that will be made.\n\nKEYWORDS: Second Amendment, 2A, 2 A, 2nd Amendment, Gun, Gun Rights, Firearm, Firearms, Rights, Firearms Rights, Firearm Rights, Right To Bear Arms, Bear Arms, Live Love Laugh, Load Aim Fire, Live, Love, Laugh, Load, Aim, Fire","creation_tsz":1615291233,"ending_tsz":1625828433,"original_creation_tsz":1594119006,"last_modified_tsz":1615291233,"price":"7.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":999,"sku":["2A"],"tags":["sticker","decal","vinyl","2A","2nd Amendment","Firearm","Gun","Bear Arms","Right To Bear Arms","Second Amendment","Rights","Live Love Laugh","Load Aim Fire"],"materials":["vinyl","glitter","holographic","glossy","adhesive","sticker","decal"],"shop_section_id":31335006,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1594119006,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/835178013\/second-amendment-2a-gun-gun-rights?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":19,"num_favorers":3,"shipping_template_id":96639688320,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":6614,"taxonomy_path":["Craft Supplies & Tools","Party & Gifting","Labels, Stickers & Tags","Stickers"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":732404114,"state":"active","user_id":231704218,"category_id":null,"title":"Live Laugh Love with Wine!

Farmhouse, wedding, or faith based. \n\n\ud83d\ude2eAnd regarding my signs, yes, I make them myself. I get the wood, cut the wood, sand with 60 grit for old fence boards, then 120 grit, prime, paint, sand it with 220 grit to shabby the edges and smooth it out, then stencil. If it gets a frame then I cut that out, glue and nail it on, then put on the hanger (rope, wire or sawtooth hangers) and then we have a sign! \n\n\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffcIf you\u2019d like to see this 61 year old lady in action, make sure to view my video \ud83c\udfa5 on my shop About me section of me using car bondo to repair veneer on some nightstands. https:\/\/etsy.me\/2mHom3r\n\n\ud83c\udfe0Please be sure to check out my whole shop to see what else I have in my attic! https:\/\/etsy.me\/2mHom3r\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;POLICIES&lt;&lt;&lt;~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\u2705 I allow 1-3 business to ship, but if you need it earlier please message me and see if it\u2019s possible to ship sooner.\n\n\u2705 If you see a sign I make, but want a different color please let me know.
