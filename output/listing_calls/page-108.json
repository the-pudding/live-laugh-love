If it&#39;s there, it&#39;s because I thought it added something to the piece.\n\nYour one of a kind sea glass creation is currently in my studio, ready to be shipped.\n\nTHINGS TO KNOW\n\n*Your item will be safely packaged into a box for delivery, including literature explaining my sea glass finds in detail.\n\n*Please read the FAQs for return policy\n\n*Please note everything is handmade and therefore comes with its own imperfections and unique character.\n\n*I do my best to show true colours but due to variations in computer monitors, there will be variations in colour depending on monitor settings and lighting.\n\n* There is very little symmetry when working with genuine sea glass, therefore measurements although as accurate as I can be, are an approximation or an average of the uneven ups and downs.\n\n\n---------------WHAT IS SEA GLASS?--------------- \n\nThere is a mystery and a beauty about \u2018genuine\u2019 sea glass that is unlike anything else, it&#39;s the result of nature taking our rubbish and turning it into something beautiful. \n\nSea glass comes from glass objects that somehow found their way into the ocean, here they are tossed and tumbled amongst the water and sand for sometimes as long as 100 years, to acquire their characteristic texture and shape. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to find these pieces washed up onto the beach like little jewels. While beachcombing I also collect rubbish, so I\u2019m cleaning up the beach and making art!","creation_tsz":1616467250,"ending_tsz":1627008050,"original_creation_tsz":1606016084,"last_modified_tsz":1616467250,"price":"28.00","currency_code":"AUD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["Genuine sea glass","Sea glass gift","Beach theme gift","Sea glass key ring","key ring","beach glass gift","beach lover gift","seaglass stack","sea glass collector","surfers keyring","fish charm sea glass","sea glass lover","live laugh love"],"materials":["Genuine Sydney sea glass","key ring","seaglass stack","fish clasp","live laugh love charm"],"shop_section_id":26340062,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1615088619,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/895516986\/genuine-sea-glass-keyring-stacked-sea?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":12,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":72521154482,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":4,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2020_2021","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"g","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"mm","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":165,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Keychains & Lanyards","Keychains"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":630013404,"state":"active","user_id":63956666,"category_id":null,"title":"Fire Hose &quot;infiniti Family&quot; Wall Sign Handmade With Retired Fire Hose Perfect Gift For Home","description":"Wall Sign Decor Handmade From Retired Repurposed FireFighter Fire Hose.
