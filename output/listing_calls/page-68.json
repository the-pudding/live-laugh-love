Don&#39;t be a Dick ? Perfect, straight to the point, easy peasy life wisdom to live by !\nThis funny wooden sign shows off lovely crisp white lettering scrawled across beautifully dark stained wood. It&#39;s rustic, primitive, simple style is gorgeous yet imperfect.. kinda like you and I, am I right ?! \nThis piece also makes for an excellent birthday or holiday gift !\nApproximately 16&quot; x 5\u201d\n\n*It is important to note that each piece of wood is different, especially when salvaging and working with recycled wood. This means that each woody goodie may vary ever so slightly in look and size, but will still be just as awesome as the last. (Maybe even more so !)","creation_tsz":1614462226,"ending_tsz":1624826626,"original_creation_tsz":1584645094,"last_modified_tsz":1615596267,"price":"45.00","currency_code":"CAD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["Bestfriend Gift","Funny Gf Gift","Funny Quotes Sign","Wood Sign Funny","Funny Welcome Sign","Cool Wife Gift","Wife Gag Gift","Humorous Wood Sign","Hubby Gift","Wooden Sign Sayings","Dont Be a Dick Sign","Live Laugh Love","Funny Wooden Sign"],"materials":["varnish","vinyl","Recycled Wood","Stain","Love"],"shop_section_id":29838758,"featured_rank":2,"state_tsz":1610837135,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/788058813\/dont-be-a-dick-wooden-sign-future?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":237,"num_favorers":35,"shipping_template_id":69557526975,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"750","item_weight_unit":"g","item_length":"480","item_width":"180","item_height":"80","item_dimensions_unit":"mm","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2844,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings","Signs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":200529992,"state":"active","user_id":51971743,"category_id":null,"title":"Live Laugh Love Switchplate-Switchplates-Light Switch Cover- Custom Light Switch Plate Cover Home Decor","description":"Thank you for checking out our custom made light switch covers!
