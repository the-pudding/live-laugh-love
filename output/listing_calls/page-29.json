We use a mixture or reclaimed and or pallet wood,  as well as distressing new timber, therefore it is impossible to duplicate a sign exactly. Due to using old pallet wood, there might be some non-structural cracks, knots and slight imperfections that give wonderful character to each sign. Every plaque is lovingly painted and sanded back to reveal some of the wood grain. We hand paint our wooden plaques with the typography wording and quotes. If you would like to personalise or change any wording you can do so \n\nFor a bespoke service, please message any variations you would like at time of ordering. As each plaque is made to order, there will be slight variations in stain colour aswell as differences in the design and painting.\n\nMake a lasting impression with our beautiful, thoughtful personalised keepsakes.\n\nwww.facebook.com\/signsatsimplywood\/","creation_tsz":1618427970,"ending_tsz":1628968770,"original_creation_tsz":1451912838,"last_modified_tsz":1618559359,"price":"35.00","currency_code":"GBP","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["dandelion wall art","blowing in the wind","live love laugh","shabby chic style","hand made","custom and bespoke","wooden plaque sign","pallet art","reclaimed timber","seed wind blow","rustic hand painted","whitewash blues"],"materials":["wood","paint","timber"],"shop_section_id":17958427,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1618496078,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/262468497\/dandelions-blowing-in-the-wind-bespoke?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":867,"num_favorers":27,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"g","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"mm","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Rustic"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":false,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2844,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings","Signs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":832048022,"state":"active","user_id":225293310,"category_id":null,"title":"24x36 Size, Live Laugh Love Sign,  Live Laugh Love  Print, Live Laugh Love Printable Posters (Set of 3),Live Love Laugh Living Room Wall Art","description":"24x36 Size, Live Laugh Love Sign,  Live Laugh Love  Print, Live Laugh Love Printable Posters (Set of 3),Live Love Laugh Living Room Wall Art\n\nDIGITAL DOWNLOAD ONLY !!!\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Simply download, print and hang! \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nPrintable art is the easiest and fastest way to decorate your space.
