Every plaque can be customised and adapted to suit you with personalised hanging hearts in white and brown. Our shabby chic wall art is tied and finished with raffia, ribbon or hessian jute. The ribbon used in the photographs may or may not be used on your sign depending on availability,  We will do our best to supply the ribbon of your choice, but if there is a lack of availability or stock we will supply an alternative,\n\nIf you have a personal preference for wording, or colours please send us a message.\n\nAs with my other signs this one is completely handmade by me, each sign is painted and sanded back to reveal the wood and wood garain beneath. Individual markings will differ slightly from sign to sign. \n\nThanks for visiting Signsatsimplywood\nfind us on Facebook https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/signsatsimplywood\/","creation_tsz":1618940371,"ending_tsz":1629481171,"original_creation_tsz":1611665031,"last_modified_tsz":1618994528,"price":"14.50","currency_code":"GBP","quantity":5,"sku":[],"tags":["wooden hearts","wooden plaque","wooden sign","live love laugh","rustic home decor","custom family sign","Family life begins","personalised family","family name sign","Family wall sign","love never ends","Wedding gift","new home gift"],"materials":["Wood","Acrylic"],"shop_section_id":17958427,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1618496078,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/936084088\/family-sign-custom-personalised-family?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":445,"num_favorers":28,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"g","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"mm","is_private":false,"recipient":"not_specified","occasion":null,"style":["Rustic"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":false,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":2844,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings","Signs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":"5","keywords":null,"sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":"live laugh love","taxonomy_id":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false"},"type":"Listing","pagination":{"effective_limit":25,"effective_offset":100,"next_offset":125,"effective_page":5,"next_page":6}}
