Clean the surface thoroughly with soapy water (a couple of drops of dish washing liquid in a 500ml spray bottle should do) then dry with a cloth. Measure and mark the exact spot where your sticker is going. \n\n2.   Position your sticker in place using the masking tape, leaving one end free. If the sticker is too long, you can place the masking tape in the center and do it in 2 steps.\n\n3.   Peel back the application tape gently, making sure the sticker is stuck on it. Discard the backing sheet. (Cut half of the backing sheet with scissors if you need to)\n\n4.   Hold the sticker from the free end and pull tightly close to the surface but don&#39;t let it touch the surface yet.  \n\n5.   With the squeegee in the other hand, start applying some pressure on the sticker towards the inside, in an up and down movement until you reach the end. Remember to keep an eye on the alignment of your sticker. \n\n6.   Run the squeegee along your sticker a few more times with more pressure to achieve strong adhesion.\n\n7.   Peel back the application tape gently, making sure not to peel the sticker off with it.\n\n8.

This shipping service generally takes 2-3 business days to most of the US (that&#39;s all it says on the USPS website). We will usually ship your item within 2 business days, but due to every order being custom cut in custom colors, it may take up to 2-5 business days for your item to ship, and even longer on larger items. However, we do send a shipping confirmation upon shipping the item.\r\n\r\nInternational orders will be shipped in the same 2-5 business day period, but will take a bit longer to get to you. We ship all international orders via USPS First Class Mail and it can take 10-20 business days (possibly longer) for you to receive your item. \r\n\r\n***INTERNATIONAL ORDERS MAY HAVE A CUSTOMS FEE. THIS IS AN IMPORT TAX PLACED BY YOUR COUNTRY THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FEES.***\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCUSTOMIZE IT :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou want to buy but you&#39;d like a different size?
