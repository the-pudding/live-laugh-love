These bold black and white decorative books serve as a healthy daily reminder to enjoy life and all it has to offer. Three NEW hardcover books are given new designer clothes with the application of custom book covers featuring an eye-catching black and white color scheme. You can select whether you&#39;d like the background in black and the text in white (as shown in the photos) or to have the reverse color scheme -- white background black text. The books are sure to make a statement on your bookshelf or coffee table. Pair them with some of my other black and white-themed books to make your own library. The placement of the title on these books allows them to be situated vertically or horizontally, whichever way you prefer.\n\nThe details:\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  NUMBER OF BOOKS:  3, as shown\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  BOOK DETAILS:  Unless specified otherwise, these sets are made with NEW generic hardcover novels (both fiction and non-fiction) that are selected randomly based on size. The books are generic in nature and do not relate the quote, topic, or any particular theme. Once they\u2019re newly attired, they\u2019re meant to be beautiful bookshelf art! \ud83d\udc95\n\nNow offering 3 sizes of new blank books\/journals! These blank books provide a perfect opportunity to use your set as journals, wedding guest books, photo albums, recipe catalogs, etc.....tons of options! You can easily upgrade to blank books\/journals in the drop-down menu.\n\nThese sets can also be made with larger-format books (either a mix of generic coffee-table-size books), or with larger blank books\/journals. If interested, please contact me for details.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  BOOK DIMENSIONS:  New generic hardcover books = approx. 9.25\u201d wide x 6.25\u201d deep x 1-1.7\u201d spines\n\nNew standard-size blank books\/journals = 9.25\u201d wide x 7\u201d deep x 1.3\u201d spines  (If looking for a larger-size journal, or a pyramid-shaped stack, please contact me prior to placing an order.)\n\n* Dimensions of books are approximate; sizes may vary slightly.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  COLORS: Your choice! Please see photos for all standard color combinations. \n\n\ud83d\udcd6  PRODUCTION SPECIFICS:  Most of my custom books have specialty covers that feature a soft-touch lamination finish for beauty and durability (similar to the book jacket finish of high-end book publishers). The interior flaps of the covers are attached so the covers fit securely. \n\nThe fabric covered books are covered entirely in fabric (permanent finish). \n\n\ud83d\udcd6  PRODUCTION TIME: Standard orders typically take 1-2 weeks production time.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  SHIPPING: All books ship via USPS Media Mail, which can take anywhere from 5-15 business days. Please contact me if you have a specific need-by date to receive an expedited shipping quote. \n\n\ud83d\udcd6  CUSTOM ORDERS:  Looking for a different color combination or text? I\u2019m happy to accommodate special requests!
