This living room wall art comes in a fresh farmhouse style lettering and looks like it&#39;s painted on your wall because we use only high quality matte vinyl.\n\nWe have 60 colors to choose from for our vinyl wall decals - the colors in the drop down menu above are the most popular colors.  The rest of our colors can be viewed by scrolling over the photo and following the right arrow to our color chart.  Let us know in a &quot;note to buyer&quot; if you would like one of these alternate colors from our color chart.\n\nQuestions? Convo us - we&#39;d love to help!\n\nABOUT OUR WALL GRAPHICS:\n\n*All Old Barn Rescue Company graphics are copyright designs. They are for personal use only and may not be used in resale.\n\nOur vinyl has a MATTE finish and can go on any CLEAN, smooth, dry, non-porous surface (wall, glass, plastic, etc.). It is removable although not reusable. (Please note, upon removal slight \n\nYou don&#39;t have to put each letter on individually! Application instructions are included with every shipment.\n\n**Important note about wall graphics: wall graphics need to be applied in a timely manner, preferably within 2 weeks of receiving your shipment. The longer the vinyl sits after being cut, the harder it becomes to release from the backing paper. As you plan the timing of your purchase, also know that new paint needs to cure at least 2 weeks before applying vinyl or the vinyl will not want to stick.\n\nSHIPPING:\n\nEvery effort will be made to produce your order as fast as possible upon receipt of payment (usually within 3 days). Please note custom orders may take up to 5 business days to process.\n\nWe ship via USPS First Class Mail.\n\nPAYMENT:\n\nWe accept Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\n\nIf you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return any unused decals to us within 7 days of purchase for a full refund of the purchase price (minus shipping).\n\nWe will continue to introduce new designs so check back often.

If you want to see the latest date that your order is scheduled to ship go to your Your Account=&gt;Purchases and click on the receipt for your order. Orders are usually shipped before that date, but in times of high volume it could take that long. If you need your order by a particular date, like a gift-giving occasion, please leave a note at checkout and we will do our best to accommodate. If that is not possible we will be happy to provide an image of the item to print so that you don&#39;t have to show up empty-handed!\n\nAlso check the shop announcement for the most current production time.\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MadamePoindextra?ref=listing_127124183\n\nINTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\nPlease be aware that items shipped to your country may be detained in customs for an undetermined period of time. There is no way to contact the customs office to find your item and, except for Canada, tracking only works while the item is in the U.S. In the near future there will tracking to about 30 other countries, many of which are in the European Union. Many countries may require 4-6 weeks from the time the order leaves the U.S. until it is delivered to your door. This requires a certain amount of trust and patience. If an item takes longer than six weeks please contact us.\n\nAlso be aware that some countries, particularly the UK, will charge a VAT tax to import your purchase into the country.
