Add to cart and complete your purchase.\n\n2. You need to print from a computer NOT a tablet or phone. Download the PDF file from the link you will receive via email after you complete your purchase. Check your spam folder if nothing shows up in your inbox. Download letter size or A4 size depending on size of paper you wish to print on. North America is letter size and A4 is for across the pond.\n\n4. Open the PDF on your computer. Please use the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader to open your files. MAC USERS: Please download and use Adobe Acrobat Reader NOT Preview. FREE for everyone here: \u200bhttps:\/\/get.adobe.com\/reader\/  \n\n5. Print it! You can print on your card stock or premium photo paper and set your printer\u2019s settings to borderless, marginless or full bleed for 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d (or A4 for international customers) to ensure proper size. Change your output settings to High, Photo Print (matte paper) or your printer\u2019s best print setup. This will ensure proper color output and crisp printing. I recommend using good quality 65lb- 110lb bright white matte card stock. Premium weight photo paper is another great option in matte or soft gloss Alternatively, save your file onto a USB stick and take to your local printer for professional printing.\n\n6. Score along the score lines first then cut along the cut guides (you may want to use a straight edge and a blade to make the cut). Make sure all of the gray guides are cut away! Fold the sides of the envelope in put glue on the folds and then fold up the back and let dry.\n\n7. Fold card and envelope flap and TA DA! A card and envelope!\n_________\n\nNOTE:\n- The colors of the printed card might be slightly different than the colors on the screen. That is inevitable due to differences between different monitors and the capacities of different printers.

I have lots of colors, styles & fonts at my disposal.\n\nEach sign in my shop is hand painted and sprayed with a satin topcoat for years of durability.  A saw-tooth hanger is attached to the back for easy hanging.\n\nBecause each sign is individually hand made, no two signs are alike and will vary slightly in appearance. Each board chosen will have natural imperfections such as knots, nicks, different grain patterns and tones.  I try my best to represent the true colors of the paint and lettering, but there may be some slight variation due to the differences in computer screens as well as lighting in your home.\n\nFor custom signs, please allow 1 week following customer approval for processing.  Shipping times vary depending on location.  All signs are made in and shipped from Minnesota.","creation_tsz":1615341638,"ending_tsz":1625878838,"original_creation_tsz":1515617766,"last_modified_tsz":1617043352,"price":"20.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":7,"sku":[],"tags":["Hand Painted","Wedding Gift","Wooden sign","Anniversary Gift","Shower Gift","Mother's Day Gift","Valentine Gift","Live Laugh Love","Inspirational Saying"],"materials":["Wood","Acrylic Paint","Polyurethane"],"shop_section_id":21149665,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1616609569,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/571709078\/live-laugh-love-wooden-sign?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":161,"num_favorers":10,"shipping_template_id":62355772892,"processing_min":2,"processing_max":6,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"20","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"16","item_width":"4","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":2844,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings","Signs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":642054322,"state":"active","user_id":169685876,"category_id":null,"title":"Mug with sayings Unique coffee mug Customized mug Coffee mug gift Vintage mug Christmas mug Coffee mug Coffee lover gift Gift for girlfriend","description":"Mug with sayings Unique coffee mug Customized mug Coffee mug gift Vintage mug Christmas mug Coffee mug Coffee lover gift Gift for girlfriend\n\nABOUT LISTING\n\nMake any hour happier with our awesome 17oz campfire mug.
