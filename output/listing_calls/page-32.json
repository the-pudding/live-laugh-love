Test decal\r\n\r\n*Made from a smoke free home.\n\nOur vinyl decals are used to enhance your home decor with inspirational, motivational, and comforting messages.  Their messages can also bring joy to you and your family as you use them to decorate for each holiday season (Valentine&#39;s Day, 4th of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas), or wedding celebration.  Each and every vinyl decal is made with high attention to detail in order to provide you with the very best product.  It is important to me that you are proud of your purchase and happy to display it in your home.  I started this business in 2012 because of my love for vinyl and the beauty it brings to all home decor and I hope it brings you joy in your home.\n\nOur removable vinyl decals are a matte finish and can be a great addition to your home decor with application to a wall, window, mirror, front door, interior door, finished or painted wood.  My two favorite places to apply the vinyl are to a wall or door. A family favorite are the toilet vinyl decals for holidays.\n\nTo see our Christmas hanging ornament decal click the link below...\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/209388442\/hanging-ornaments-toilet-vinyl-christmas?ref=shop_home_active_7&frs=1 \n\nWondering how vinyl decals are applied?  Here are the application instructions that will be included with your purchase...\n\nAPPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1.  Clean the surface you wish to apply the vinyl to, to remove any dust or dirt.  This will allow the vinyl to stick better to the surface.\n2.  Measure and mark as a guide to ensure your vinyl goes on straight.\n3.  Anchor the top of the vinyl with tape in multiple positions.\n4.  Rub saying with the card provided.  Flip layer up and remove the bottom layer.  Start at the top and smooth down.  (If your phrase is long, you might want to cut it into smaller pieces after you have attached it with tape.)\n5.  Rub vinyl again with card and begin to remove adhesive cover.  Remove slowly and carefully so the vinyl does not get torn or stretched.\n6.  Congratulations!  You just applied your vinyl.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Applying vinyl to surfaces with a matte finish requires extra care and attention to ensure the vinyl adheres to the surface during transfer tape removal.","creation_tsz":1615376443,"ending_tsz":1625913643,"original_creation_tsz":1393457668,"last_modified_tsz":1615376443,"price":"14.29","currency_code":"USD","quantity":83,"sku":[],"tags":["vinyl","wall","decal","decor","family","live","laugh","love","every","moment","day","beyond words"],"materials":["vinyl"],"shop_section_id":11815155,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1608228145,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/180823257\/live-every-moment-laugh-every-day-love?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":451,"num_favorers":39,"shipping_template_id":127077458,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1027,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":220851148,"state":"active","user_id":14799028,"category_id":null,"title":"Hand-drawn mandala Greeting Card-Live laugh love card-4x6 card-Birthday card-mandala card-Dictionary quote card-design NATURA PICTA NPGC086","description":"Hello;)\nWelcome to our section of fabulous handmade greeting cards.\nYou will find amazing designs for any occasion.\nChoose your favorite!\nThank you!\nNATURA PICTA\n\nITEM DESCRIPTION:\n----------------------------\n\n*** 4x6 inches.\n\n*** Natural paper which does not derive from virgin forests.\n\n*** Inside options:\n- blank\n- custom phrase.\nSelect your preference in the drop-down menu during your checkout.\n\n*** White envelope included.\n\n*** Packaging:\nPacked with care and protected by cellophane bag.\n\n***Shipping:\nDispatched by Italian Priority mail not trackable.\nExpress courier available trackable.

Check your spam folder if nothing shows up in your inbox. Download letter size or A4 size depending on size of paper you wish to print on. North America is letter size and A4 is for across the pond.\n\n4. Open the PDF on your computer. Please use the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader to open your files. MAC USERS: Please download and use Adobe Acrobat Reader NOT Preview. FREE for everyone here: \u200bhttps:\/\/get.adobe.com\/reader\/  \n\n5. Print it! You can print on your card stock or premium photo paper and set your printer\u2019s settings to borderless, marginless or full bleed for 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d (or A4 for international customers) to ensure proper size. Change your output settings to High, Photo Print (matte paper) or your printer\u2019s best print setup. This will ensure proper color output and crisp printing. I recommend using good quality 65lb- 110lb bright white matte card stock. Premium weight photo paper is another great option in matte or soft gloss Alternatively, save your file onto a USB stick and take to your local printer for professional printing.\n\n6. Score along the score lines first then cut along the cut guides (you may want to use a straight edge and a blade to make the cut). Make sure all of the gray guides are cut away! Fold the sides of the envelope in put glue on the folds and then fold up the back and let dry.\n\n7. Fold card and envelope flap and TA DA!

After hours of work each sign is truly special and unique.\n\nYou can decide whether you would prefer to hang it on the wall or use the dowel stand it on a book shelf, desk, or wherever you choose!\n\nAfter receiving your order I will have your sign ready to ship in 7 days.\n\nCarefully crafted and handmade from:\n-High quality oak or pine boards\n-Matte finish\n-Letters cut carefully from real book pages.

Please note that oak boards respond differently to the solution so some will be lighter or darker than what appears.\n2) Stained Oak with a beautiful Dark Walnut stain\n3) Pine board with layered paint (white beneath with top layer dark brown) and textured to give it a distressed appearance\n\nHow long does it take to ship?\nBecause it is made to order it takes about 7 days to ship. My signs are truly unique and there are many steps that to go into them. I also want to make sure that they will last for a very long time and triple finish them. Between each coat I give them a full cure and then the final coat is left to cure for at least 3 days.\n\nCustom:\nI also make custom signs from specific books, maps, or special paper items (wedding cards, baby shower invitations, etc.) with any word or phrase you would like.
