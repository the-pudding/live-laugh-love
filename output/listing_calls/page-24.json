The 2 different styles we sell are TPU rubber silicone and 2-Piece Dual Layer.\n\nTPU rubber silicone cases are our level one protection.

It is a printed image on a case.\n\nProtect the back of your phone with style and personality. Lightweight and offers a slim profile. Please note this case does not cover the front screen in any way.\n\nPROCESS: Each item is embellished with my creative designs one at a time using a unique printing technique that allows me to permanently instill an image onto a thin aluminum insert that is placed on the back of the molded plastic case. The insert is heated using a unique print process, cooled and permanently adhered to the phone case. The result is a vibrant, permanent imprint that is smudge, scratch, water and fade resistant. \n\nPRODUCT CARE: Clean with a dry cloth or fabric. Feel free to use your fingers to wipe it down also (lol). Do NOT come into contact with keys or sharp objects (knives, razors, porcupines etc). Do NOT handle with alcohol liquids, liquid bleach or corrosive chemicals.
