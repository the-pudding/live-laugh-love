Whether added to a wreath or adding a ribbon to hang it is beautiful.  It  is sublimated and can be ordered in 3 sizes. These signs are very sturdy and on sublimated hard board or Mdf as some know it . They can be cleaned with alcohol or just a damp cloth. They are very versatile and will last for years. I recommend using glue on zip tie holders to hold them on the wreath these can be purchased at Amazon. They can be placed outside on a covered porch as long as they are not rained on.  They come in 3 popular sizes but if you have a need for a different size message me I can make them to order. All sublimation signs are made of HDF :Also referred to as hardboard, a high density fiberboard (HDF) for flooring is a type of engineered wood product. It&#39;s made from wood fiber extracted from chips and pulped wood waste.
