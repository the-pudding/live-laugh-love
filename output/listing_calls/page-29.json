It has a hanger attached on the back for easy wall hanging or it could sit on a mantle piece or shelf. Made in the USA.\n\n All of the country and primitive prints that we finish are published work from various country artists such as Billy Jacobs, John Rossini, Ed Wargo, Lori Dieter, Robin-Lee Vieira, Tanya Crawford, Mary Ann June, Linda Spivey, Kim Norlien, Jim Hansel and others. The prints are adhered to a hard backboard and then a protective coating is applied to insure a long carefree life that adds a unique appearance which resembles a canvas original.\n\nThe handmade frames are cut from custom millwork which is of the highest quality material. The finished work can be displayed in any d\u00e9cor and enhances every type of style from formal and fancy to country and farmhouse. Because of the nature of real wood frames, each one is unique and a one-of-a-kind handmade piece. All are similar in appearance and match in size and style that compliment each other in paired or group settings. The black painted satin finish can also be custom ordered with a sanded primitive edge or also in other rustic colors. Custom orders are welcome, please message with requests.\n\nThe satisfaction and happiness of the customer are the two most important parts that go into each and every piece from Boggy Creek Primitives.
