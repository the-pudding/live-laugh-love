This rustic sign is distressed and antiqued to give a prim look and makes a wonderful gift for just about anyone. \n\nThis handpainted sign is made to order. Shipment is generally 3 to 5 business days. Signs shown are Black and Antique White and Brown and Antique White. \n\nEach sign measures approximately 12 inches by 16 inches. For this sign we use blondewood, approx. 3\/8 inch thick.  Our handcrafted creations are made using a 7 step process which creates a beautiful expression to be cherished for years to come. Two contrasting colors of paint are applied first. Then the saying is applied to the sign with a fine hairline added on all of the lettering which gives an awesome touch. After those steps are completed the sign is cleaned and goes through our antiquing process with edges distressed, giving it the final touches. Ready to Hang with hanger attached on the back side. \n\nThere are various color choices to choose from but if you don&#39;t see what you are looking for, please let us know and we will see if we can make it happen for you. Keep in mind when selecting the color options listed, the first color is the base color, while the second color is the top coat. The most popular color for our signs is Black and Antique White by far. The second most popular color is Brown and Antique White. \n\nPlease let us know what color you want in the note section when ordering. If no color is specified we will make the sign using Black and Antique White.\n\nCOLOR CHOICES INCLUDE\nBlack\/Antique White\nBlack\/Country Tan\nBlack\/Light Pink\nBlack\/Sunflower\nBarn Red\/Antique White\nBarn Red\/Country Tan\nBurgundy\/Antique White\nBurgundy\/Country Tan\nBrown\/Antique White\nBrown\/Light Pink\nBrown\/Hot Pink\nBrown\/Sunflower\nBrown\/Sky Blue\nPurple\/Antique White\nHunter Green\/Antique White\nJohnDeere Green\/Sunflower\nMidnite Blue\/Antique White \n\n\nPlease note these signs are not massed produced but each is unique and no two are exactly the same.

It is also easy to remove without damage to walls and other surfaces.  However, it cannot be repositioned or re-used. It adheres best to clean, dry, smooth surfaces: painted walls, glass, metal, doors, cabinet doors, plastic, sanded wood, tile, cell phones, laptops, car windows, etc.  Small color samples are available on request.\n \nMany sizes are available and I can adjust the size to fit your space.  As the size goes up or down the price will change accordingly. Convo me for pricing for specialized designs. \n\nEach order comes with a small vinyl sample (so you can practice) and an applicator card.  For perfect placement most orders have several &quot;+&quot; signs across the top which are center and level marks.  For orders with multiple colors, triangles are placed in the design for perfect alignment as shown in the last picture for those listings.","creation_tsz":1613503282,"ending_tsz":1623867682,"original_creation_tsz":1463424568,"last_modified_tsz":1613503282,"price":"14.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":21,"sku":[],"tags":["mangia bene","ridi spesso","ama molto","italian quote","family name","established date","family wall decal","home decor","kitchen wall decor","laugh often","eat well","live laugh love","kitchen decal"],"materials":["Oracal vinyl","Transfer tape","Vinyl stickers","Decals"],"shop_section_id":15004563,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1607870076,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/280527340\/mangia-bene-ridi-spesso-ama-molto-family?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":754,"num_favorers":30,"shipping_template_id":2962902732,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1028,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Decals & Murals"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":950188796,"state":"active","user_id":23001427,"category_id":null,"title":"Star Sign Name Necklace - Gemini","description":"Gemini: May 22 \u2013 June 21\nBest traits: Affectionate, adaptable, curious and gentle\nAre you a true Gemini?
