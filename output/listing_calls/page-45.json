You will receive all 3 candles and you also get to choose the scent you would like. You can choose 1 scent for all candles or you can choose 3 different scents. It&#39;s your choice! We have many scents to choose from. When placing your order, just message me in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at checkout with what scents you would like.\n\nIf this is a gift and you would like your candle sent directly to the recipient, just notate their name and address in the &quot;Shipping&quot; section.  \n\nLavender\n\nCaribbean Teakwood\n\nApples Maple Bourbon\n\nVery Vanilla\n\nSunwashed Linen\n\nLove Spell\n\nBirthday Cake\n\nHawaiian Sunrise\n\nGreen Apple Essence \n\nApple Cinnamon\n\nSmoky Mountain Pine\n\nCoconut Mango\n\nFresh Cut Roses\n\nBlack Raspberry Vanilla\n\nWedding Cake\n\nGeorgia Peach\n\nCedar and Sand \n\nMistletoe\n\nChristmas Tree\n\nAlmond Biscotti\n\n Sunset Beach\n\nWhite Tea & Ginger \n\nBamboo and Orchid \n\nEucalyptus Spearmint \n\nOur natural soy wax candle is homemade, hand poured and comes in a beautiful 8oz Mason jar with a pewter lid and decorative twine. Burn time for each candle is approx. 40-50 hrs.\nMeasurements:\n3.5&quot; tall\n3&quot; width\n\nI hand pour each and every candle in small batches with the greatest care of applying only quality scents to each batch. Most importantly all candles are highly scented (using the maximum amount of scent that the soy wax will allow) and also clean burning so that you get the most out of your candle. My candles are made with 100% natural soy wax. Soy wax is Eco friendly and burns without creating soot or smoke unlike other waxes. I also use only Cotton Wicks that are lead and zinc free. Once you have completely burned your candle, you are left with a reusable mason jar that can be used for many different purposes. \n\nThank you for your interest in my candles. If you have any questions or issues, please message me. My goal is to provide a high quality product and excellent customer service. We cannot be held responsible for incorrect shipping addresses. Please review this before placing your order.

Display it on your desk or a place easily visible to visitors.  It is cut from 1\/8&quot; Baltic Birch and includes a base of Eastern White pine for easy display.  The silhouette measures 6 3\/4&quot; x 9&quot;  including the base. It is painted on both sides with several coats of a deep black color paint.  It is completely handmade in the USA.\n\nMy silhouettes and wall hangings make an interesting and unique addition to any decor at home or office.  They are painted on both sides and the edges with several coats of a deep black color paint so they can be displayed in any orientation.   Display the silhouettes on a desk, shelf or bookcase.  We like to display them on window sills or on the top of the bottom sash of a double hung window. The natural back light of the outside really highlights them.  Many people have purchased our silhouettes for wedding cake toppers or reception table decorations.  In addition they have provided table decorations for many special events.  You can also use them as a wall decoration by not using the base and with a small hanger or adhesive mount them on the wall.  They make welcomed unique gifts for those on your shopping list and with our large variety of designs I am sure we have a silhouette that anyone can appreciate.\n\n A word about how I make these silhouettes.  They are totally hand cut on a scroll saw, sanded and then hand painted.  No automatic cutting machines are used and so we classify our silhouettes as handmade.  If this is of interest to you please take the extra time in reviewing our over 400 different designs.\n \n To save on shipping costs and to allow you to use the silhouette alone as a wall or furniture decoration the base and the silhouette are shipped unattached. To permanently attach the base to the silhouette just put a dab of household or common wood glue in the slot of the base and carefully insert the silhouette.\n \n  We typically ship within one business day after receipt of your payment or the clearing of your check.\n \n With any of our items you must be 100% satisfied or you may return the item within 14 days for a full refund including all shipping charges. We do ask that you contact us by email before returning an item which includes the name of the item and your preference regarding receiving the refund.\n \n Our 1\/8&quot; silhouettes are shipped first class USPS mail in a padded envelope.  It is our experience the for our packages USPS first class is just as fast as USPS priority.  Shipping charges are as displayed on the items listing and we do ship worldwide.  We do combine shipping cost on multiple item purchases.","creation_tsz":1618072236,"ending_tsz":1628613036,"original_creation_tsz":1287093983,"last_modified_tsz":1618590391,"price":"17.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":5,"sku":[],"tags":["live laugh love","love silhouette","live silhouette","laugh silhouelle","home decor","country home decor","Made in America","rustic decoration","love decoration","laugh love decor","live laugh decor","laugh cake topper","love cake topper"],"materials":["wood","baltic birch","white pine","acrylic paint"],"shop_section_id":11011596,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1550190466,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/58984077\/live-laugh-and-love-handmade-wood?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":768,"num_favorers":27,"shipping_template_id":5984622,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2019","item_weight":"5","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"11","item_width":"10","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Mid Century","Traditional"],"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1002,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":219158134,"state":"active","user_id":33408019,"category_id":null,"title":"Cow Farm Fresh Live Laugh Love Embroidered and Appliqued Kitchen Towel Set (set of 2)","description":"These useful, but pretty kitchen towels will make a great wedding, birthday, or house warming gift.
