There will  be delays and carriers will not guarantee delivery times.\n\nDue to reduced air transportation, mail from Canada to outside of N. America has been intermittent and unreliable. So unfortunately I cannot take your order if you are not in Canada or the USA. I would suggest that you save interested items in your shopping baskets and checkout later. Let&#39;s hope this will resolve soon and you can start ordering.\n\n\nTitle: Laugh\nArtist: OY Tai\n\nThe Enso represents the way of Zen as a circle of vast space, lacking nothing and holding nothing in excess.  It represents form and emptiness, void and fullness.\n\nDrawn in one fluid, expressive stroke, the enso represents the state of mind of the artist . As the brush trails off into nothingness, leaving an open circle, it is also the acceptance of imperfection as it is. \n\nThe enso circle is born from emptiness. However its center is full of potency and infinite possibility.  On this particular piece, inside the circle is the calligraphy for &quot;Laugh&quot;.  \n\nIf you are looking for an enso circle without words, see the following listing:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/ca\/listing\/400995465\/original-enso-painting-option-for-custom?ref=shop_home_active_22\n(You can also choose your own words to be custom written with the upgrade option  of the listing)\n\n \nHand painted with chinese ink on acid free 60 lb paper measuring 8&quot; x 10&quot;. This is an original, not a print. Certificate of Authenticity included. \n \nMy art has been exhibited internationally and I am a premiere member of the International Chinese Calligraphy and Ink Painting Society. Artist&#39;s website: oystudio.com\n\nAll my art is created here in my studio in Canada, and shipped worldwide.\n\nFrame and matting not included. The easiest way to frame an irregular sized artwork is to use a float frame. Simply insert the artwork between the two panes of glass with no matting or mounting necessary. You can buy them at Michaels, Walmart, etc . I have compiled here a list of float frames you can purchase directly from Amazon: http:\/\/oystudio.com\/frames.html\n\nItem will be shipped in protective flat mailer within 2 business days of receipt of payment via Canada Post Air or other courier services depending on your location. For orders outside of Canada, please also provide your phone number on your order in the box &quot;Add a Note to FlowWithTheBrush&quot; as that is needed for international delivery.\nU.S.A. - normally takes 5 to 8 business days from time of mailing\nCanada - normally takes 2 to 6 business days from time of mailing\nInternational - normally takes 6 to 10 business days from time of mailing\nBuyer is responsible for any import duties, tariff and customs.\n\nSpecial Offer: COMBINED SHIPPING: unlimited number of items per order.

Laugh. Love. Inspirational quote charm bracelet with high energy carnelian stones, sterling silver beads and a charm with a positive, inspirational message. \nOriginal length: 7 inches; Free custom sizing! \n\nCarnelian:\nA stabilizing stone with high energy\nRestores vitality and motivation \nStimulates creativity\nRelease of stress \nA well-known important fertility stone\nEncourages the body&#39;s own power of regeneration\nProvides gentle soothing energy\nAstrological associations: Taurus, Cancer, Leo\nChakra: Sacral\n\nCarnelian is a high energy stone that is great for stress release. It is a powerful stabilizing stone that provides gentle soothing energy. It helps restore vitality and motivation while releasing stress. Carnelian is also a well-known fertility stone. Made with love and positive thoughts, this wrist mala has twenty-one 8 mm high quality natural smooth round carnelian stones in many shades and hues of orange, yellow and tangerine. Each beautiful carnelian has its own unique shade that is almost translucent in the light. \n\nI accented the beautiful carnelians with two 6 mm sterling silver round beads and a silver-plated charm with the inscriptions &quot;Live Laugh Love&quot; to bring out the rich colour of the carnelians and to add significance. This eye-catching carnelian mala is perfect for stress release, emotional balance and motivation. It will help soothe and lift the spirit.  The size of the stones makes this bracelet suitable for (stacking) wearing with other bracelets. You can use it for meditation, mantras, counting or whenever you need something for stress release and to restore energy and motivation.\n\nThe lead-free, nickel-free silver-plated charm measures approximately 19 mm in diameter. It is strung on three sterling silver rings. This beautiful charm has the inscription &quot; Live Laugh Love&quot; on one side of the charm, the other side depicts the pattern of the sun&#39;s rays. \n\nThis wrist mala measures approximately 7.3&quot; or 18.5 cm and is strung on two strong stretch cords for durability.  It will fit comfortably for a wrist with a circumference of 6 to 7 inches, depending on whether you prefer a snug or loose fit. Please convo me or simply note in &quot;note to seller&quot; at time of order if you need a diiferent size. Please note that bead count will change once the size is adjusted. \n\nAbout Malas: \nMalas are sets of prayer beads that are used to keep your mind spiritually focused while reciting or mentally repeating a mantra. Mala is an ancient Sanskrit term meaning \u201cgarland\u201d. Malas are the traditional and spiritual tools of the Buddhist and Hindu religions. The strings of beads are worn over the hand or in the hand so that each bead can be counted as each prayer is recited. It is also a wonderful accessory in meditation or as \u201cworry beads\u201d.\n\n\u201cYesterday is already a dream and tomorrow is only a vision, but today well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.\u201d  \n~ Sanskrit Proverb\n\n&lt;&lt;Hier n\u2019est qu\u2019un r\u00eave et demain n\u2019est qu\u2019une illusion.

Additionally, you will receive a high-resolution PNG file (this isn&#39;t the best solution for vinyl cutting software, try the other formats first). \n\nThese files can be used with vector software (such as Adobe Illustrator), Silhouette, and Cricut machines, and other machines - please ensure that your machine is able to load one of the four file types before purchasing. If you have Silhouette Basic (not Designer Edition) you will need to use the DXF version of the file. SVG file formats are not supported on Silhouette Studio basic. PNGs are not vector-based and therefore the cut lines are not as accurate. Utilize the other formats where possible. \n\nDesigns will come in gray or black unless otherwise shown in the flat (IE, not a finished product) mockup photo. The finished product mockup photos are for demonstration purposes only. These designs are intended for craft cutting and while they CAN be used as printable files, we do not offer color changes, assistance, or troubleshooting for printing.\n\nDesigns do not include any personalization.\n\n** PLEASE NOTE: The ZIP file will be the designs only, no watermarks, backgrounds, or Tr\u00ed D\u00e9ag Designs Logos will be attached. They will be ready to use, provided that your machine and\/or software is compatible. **\n\n\n**** DIGITAL FILE ****\n\nThis is a digital file only. No physical item will be mailed and therefore no refunds will be given. We will do our best to assist with troubleshooting, but it is our customer&#39;s responsibility to make sure their software is compatible with the provided file types. \n\n** PLEASE NOTE: Our designs are not very intricate in nature, but due to thin cutting areas, they are not suitable for vinyl on drinkware or other small die-cut designs. Please consider the usage before purchasing our files. All of the designs were designed with the output size being around 8 inches wide.\n\n\n**** COMMERCIAL LICENSE ****\n\nOur commercial use license includes the rights to sell physical items made with the files. The commercial license does NOT include the rights to sell, claim as your own, or redistribute the files.
