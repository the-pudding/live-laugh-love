The first image, which is of the large stencil, is 12&quot; by 10&quot; or 304.8 by 254 mm, which is slightly larger than an A4 sheet.\nNote: the red and grey text in the images is added to protect copyright and is NOT part of the actual stencil.\n\nNEED A PERSONALIZED STENCIL?\n\nBesides stencils like these, we also make custom stencils.

Just contact us before you order and we will answer any questions you might have.\n\nHOW TO USE YOUR NEW STENCIL:\n\n1. First things first: we HIGHLY recommend turning your stencil over and writing something on the back of the foil the stencil is stuck on with a permanent marker. It doesn&#39;t matter what it says, but we write the word &quot;NO&quot; on it. This is to remind you NOT to stick the stencil back onto this side after use. If you do accidentally stick it back onto the wrong side of the clear foil your stencil will get stuck to it. I&#39;ve done this a few times by accident, try soaking your stuck stencil and carefully peeling it off the foil, trying not to stretch it.\n2. Now that you&#39;ve written on the back of the foil, peel the stencil off it and stick it to a surface of your choice, be it ceramics, fabric, wood, glass, canvas, etc; flat or curved. Apply some pressure to make it stick and avoid getting air bubbles. \n3. Now apply a thin layer of water-based paint evenly over the top with a squeegee or old credit card. A brush can be used, but using strokes only, no dabbing, as bristles may damage small details on the stencil. \n4. Take off the stencil and your print is done! \n5. Make sure to rinse the stencil carefully straight after use to remove any leftover paint before this dries. We do this under running water, you can gently rub the front of your stencil to remove any paint, but do not rub the backside, simple running water should do the trick. Don&#39;t use any scrubbing tools or paint remover items as this may ruin your stencil. \n6. Shake off any excess water and place the stencil upside down on a flat surface (like your kitchen counter). Stick it the foil back on with the writing facing you. Apply some pressure and remove any air bubbles. Dab off any excess water, flip it over and let it dry. Store it out of sunlight and reuse! \nFeel free to contact us if you have any questions.","creation_tsz":1614095461,"ending_tsz":1624459861,"original_creation_tsz":1580380612,"last_modified_tsz":1614095461,"price":"9.79","currency_code":"EUR","quantity":9,"sku":[],"tags":["smart screen stencil","self adhesive","custom silkscreen","Ready to Use","Transfer Print DIY","Reusable Calligraphy","Anniversary Gift","Live Laugh Love","Gift for Best Friend","Home Sweet Home","Housewarming Present","French Country Style","Farmhouse Wood Sign"],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":27672774,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1592619647,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/774616605\/home-sweet-home-quote-smartscreen?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":101,"num_favorers":16,"shipping_template_id":80111112223,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"g","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"mm","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":6598,"taxonomy_path":["Craft Supplies & Tools","Canvas & Surfaces","Stencils, Templates & Transfers"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":763245736,"state":"active","user_id":250816959,"category_id":null,"title":"Just Roll with It SmartScreen Stencil - Reusable, Self-adhesive - Canvas, Cards, Glass, Ceramic, Walls, Fabric, Wood, Plastic, Metal, Clay","description":"Our smart silkscreen stencils are very versatile, self-adhesive, yet easily adjustable AND reusable.
