Once you purchase the file, you\u2019ll instantly receive the downloadable files. Nothing will be physically sent to you - instead it will immediately be available on your device.\n\nWhy would I want one?\n\nSo many reasons! Digital downloads are an affordable and convenient way to decorate and refresh your space. No waiting for shipping, paying extra for delivery fees, or having to guess about the quality of the product you\u2019re getting. You get instant access to the files once payment is confirmed, so you\u2019re able to experience your purchase immediately.\n\nFrom there it\u2019s yours to customize to fit your space. Want to put it in an antique gold frame? Go for it. What if you prefer a classic black framed look? Great! One you download the file the choice is yours on how to display the art.\n\nHow do I print it?\n\nThere\u2019s three common options to print.\n\n- At home. Use your own home printer to print out the designs.\n- Local print shop. Do a quick google search to find a local print shop near you. Typically I\u2019ve used Walgreens in the past, but there\u2019s no shortage of options. From there they\u2019ll be able to provide instructions on the best ways to print from them.\n- Online print shop. Send your files to an online print shop and they\u2019ll be able to mail you your prints.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble figuring out the best way to print, send me a message and I\u2019m happy to help out.\n\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t want to print the design for wall art?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to. Again that\u2019s part of the beauty of a digital download! You can set it as the background to your computer or mobile phone, upload it to print on a different product you had in mind, or any other idea you have for personal use!\n\nAnything else?\n\nRemember when you shop on Etsy you\u2019re supporting someone\u2019s dream and hard work. They\u2019ve put thought and care into the products they\u2019ve created, and every sale means so much to them. Supporting small shops may seem like a simple thing to do, but that simple action creates a big impact.\n\n\nAny other questions?
