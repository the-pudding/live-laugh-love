So, the colors of wood here are natural colors of wood. For this feature, it&#39;s almost like one-of-a-kind because next time if we make the same design again, it won&#39;t look exactly the same as the wood grain will change slightly. Also, each piece is hand-carved individually, so it&#39;s all unique. (The actual item you&#39;ll receive maybe very slightly different than what pictured since each piece is hand-crafted individually. However, we&#39;re confident you&#39;ll love the piece you receive regarding beauty and quality. We can confirm this because we have a lot of repeated happy customers).\n\nSemi-gloss finish.\n\nIt would add a very beautiful & interesting item to your collection or make a perfect gift idea.....\n\nOverall measurements : approximately 10.25&quot; long X 7.75&quot; high X 1&quot; thick.\n\nThe frame measures approximately 7-3\/8&quot; high X 5.5&quot; wide.\n\nPhoto area measures approximately 5-7\/8&quot; high X 3-7\/8&quot; wide.\n\nItem # PF-Cat-1E\n\nHand crafted by B.Evans\n\nOriginal Price : $100\n\nToday Price : $49.95 .
