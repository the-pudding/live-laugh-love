They go perfectly in a country farmhouse, French farmhouse or primitive style house.  They are made out of drop cloths and have an over sized, old and worn look, just like an old grain sack.  The seams, rough edges and imperfections throughout add to the old rustic feel.  \n\nThe curtains measure approximately 65-70&quot; wide by 80&quot;-85&quot; long. Don&#39;t like the ruffle? With a quick press you can flip it to the back and have a more tailored look.  \n\nThe curtains are hung with curtain clips which can be purchased with your curtain or you can find them in stores such as Target, Walmart, etc.  There are NO HOLES in these curtains so you will need the curtain clips for hanging or chose the Grommet hanging option and I will add grommets to your curtain.   Check my Hardware listings to order.  \n\nStripes-\nEach curtain has three strips on each side of the pattern. (as shown in pictures) Your choice of colors are listed on the above color chart.  \n\nCare instructions--\nWash on the delicate cycle with a non harsh detergent. Hang or tumble dry low.  Iron as needed. Expect fading with each wash.  All of my items are freshly laundered prior to shipping.   If your using it as a shower curtain a liner is recommended and not included.\n\nThanks for looking!!\n\nCheck out my other listings for different designs, coordinating valances and pillows.
