It also gives you an opportunity to try our awesome Magnolia Design Co. products. Right now I only have one kit available, but I&#39;ve ordered more stencils, so I will have multiple kits available soon so that you can buy as many as you&#39;d like! \n\nNOTE: EACH kit comes with the following:\n\n-ONE &quot;Live Love Laugh&quot; 5x7&quot; reusable self-adhesive silkscreen\/vinyl stencil\n-ONE pine wood board custom cut (unfinished) into the shape of a house (sanded); it measures approx. 9&quot; tall (to peak) x 6&quot; wide x 3\/4&quot; deep. It stands up well by itself.\n-CHOOSE ONE of the sample chalk paste colors from the colors that you see: brilliant white, coal black, chocolate brown, tiffany teal, pansy purple or candy apple red.\n-ONE mini squeegee\n-ONE stir stick\n-ONE instruction &quot;how to&quot; sheet (it&#39;s on the back of the stencil packaging)\n\nEverything you need to create something fun while spending time together crafting\/creating. Think Art Class!\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE\/STEP: I am sending the wood house unfinished (it&#39;s sanded) so that you can choose to either leave natural or paint whatever color you&#39;d like. Important: You should use some type of wax on it and let it dry a few hours Before you apply the stencil, so that the stencil doesn&#39;t stick and ruin the stencil or pull up the chalk paste. You should also &quot;FUZZ&quot; the stencil quite a few times on a towel before placing it on the board so that it doesn&#39;t pull up the paste\/paint. The wax that I use is shown in the last picture.\n\n----------------\n\nDo you love to create beautiful high-end DIY? If you&#39;re crafty or even not so crafty, this is an easy foolproof way to design beautiful projects for your home, office, to give as gifts, etc. Join me on my Magnolia Design Co. journey! I am a Founding Member of Magnolia Design Co. The stencils are reusable (wash after use and place on backing). The chalk pastes and inks are super easy to use! We carry many different sizes of stencils, surfaces, chalk pastes, inks, and accessories. Our products can be used on almost any surface, i.e. wood, glass, plastic, metal, fabric, etc.\n\nDIRECTIONS: Using our products is as easy as 1-2-3, First, put the stencil on a towel a few times to &quot;fuzz it&quot;, put the stencil on the surface, stir the chalk paste and apply it with the mini squeegee and then peel away the stencil to reveal the finished project. If the chalk paste seems a little dry due to shipping, you can squirt a tiny bit of distilled water into it and stir before applying. It should be the consistency of sour cream or yogurt. Easy Peasy!\n\n*Important: Be sure to wash your stencil immediately after use to prevent clogging in the silkscreen. Run under cool water and lightly rub off the chalk paste. Lay flat to dry (front side facing down). Use a clorox (or similar) wipe on the backside too if you have one, as it will help keep it sticky for future uses. It is reusable!\n\nBe sure to visit my SweetChalkinWoman Facebook page at: www.facebook.com\/SweetChalkinWoman to see all of our great products and stay up-to-date on all of our new releases and much more!
