Pick a size. \nDimensions listed are height x width (in inches). These dimensions are the overall size of the decal from the highest point to the lowest point in the design. \nPlease keep in mind, if you&#39;d like different size options we can get you any size you&#39;d like. Just let us know under the ASK A QUESTION tab.\n\n2. Select your preferred color. \nThis wall decal has many color option. See photo above for available colors. This listing is for Oracal 651 indoor matte vinyl. If you would like a stickier, outdoor material we have that too. Just let us know. \n\n*IMAGES DISPLAYED ARE FOR REFERENCE ONLY AND MAY NOT REFLECT EXACT SIZE AND\/OR COLOR.\n\n--------------------------------\nSHIPPING AND RETURNS\n--------------------------------\n\nProcessing takes approximately 2-3 days (however, we are generally even faster). \n\nWe want you to be happy with your purchase. If you are having difficulty with installing please let us know. We want to help. There are several tricks we may be able to give to make it easier on your end. If you are not happy with the product itself, we do offer refunds on non-custom cuts (minus the shipping charges. Keep in mind, there may be a 20% restocking fee). Returns must be in original, unused condition. \n\n-------------------\nINSTALLATION\n-------------------\n\nWe have these way cute, cheesy installation videos you can watch here: http:\/\/installationvideos.com \nRicherd addresses every install issue we have ever run across and how to address them. Also, we are always an email away if you have any issues. \n\nDust your wall, DO NOT wash with chemicals as this could leave a film on your wall. Soapy water is ok if you feel in is needed. Decals must be applied to a smooth, flat, clean, and dry surface (such as walls, windows, tile, mirrors, doors, etc.). Textured wall do affect install. We are yet to find a wall we haven&#39;t gotten to work. Some just require a little more elbow grease (as Richerd shows in his video titled &quot;Tough Vinyl Lettering Install.&quot; \n\nVinyl is a removable product. We use Oracal 631 which is the best on the market at this time. Some say it isn&#39;t as good as what they have received in the past. All I have to say to them is wait until you go to remove your super sticky decal that went on way easy. Not all vinyl is equal. We sell that super sticky vinyl as well. It&#39;s meant for outdoor signs. And I&#39;d be happy to sell it to you just note it may pull off your paint and possibly your sheetrock as well when you go to remove it.\n\n-----------------------\nCUSTOM ORDERS\n-----------------------\n\nCustom orders are our specialty here at Vinyl 4 Decor. We sell more custom than anything by far. The possibilities are endless. Select ASK A QUESTION to the right of your screen under the listing info and let us know what we can help you with. We can get you a bid as well as a proof right away.\n Also, we have been in business for going on 10 years with several retail locations.

Your at the right place! As a graphic designer, I personally design each wall decal myself. I love creating and designing modern art that is unique and individual.\n\nWHY FIXATE DESIGNS\nAll my wall decals are made from a matte vinyl like material which closely mimics a painted design. Every design is individually &#39;cut&#39; out, NOT printed like other cheaper imitations which leave a shiny clear film between letters and designs. All our wall decals are fully removable which means that if you ever want to redecorate you can peel it off without damaging your surfaces..\n\nINCLUDED IN PACKAGE\n1x Design\n1x Transfer Film (for easy application)\n1x Instructions\n1x Practice Decal \n\nHave any problems?
