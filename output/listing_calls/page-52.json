This sign measures approximately 12 inches by 5.5 inches. Sign shown is in Black\/Antique White. Be You no one is more qualified\r\n\r\n\r\nOur handcrafted creations are made using a 7 step process to create a beautiful expression to be cherished for years to come. Two contrasting colors of paint are applied first. Then the saying is applied to the sign, with a fine hairline used on all of the lettering which gives an awesome touch. After those steps are completed the sign is cleaned and goes through our antiquing process with edges distressed, giving it the final touches. It will have a hanger attached on the back.\r\n\r\nWe have used one font on this sign,  but used  all upper case on the top and all lower case on the second line to give it an unique touch. There are various color choices to choose from but if you don&#39;t see what you are looking for, please let us know and we will see if we can make it happen for you. Keep in mind when selecting the color options, the first color is the base color, while the second color is the top coat.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what color you want in the note section when ordering\r\n\r\nCOLOR CHOICES INCLUDE\r\nBlack\/Antique White\r\nBlack\/Country Tan\r\nBarn Red\/Antique White\r\nBarn Red\/Country Tan\r\nBurgundy\/Antique White\r\nBurgundy\/Country Tan\r\nBrown\/Antique White\r\nBrown\/Light Pink\r\nBrown\/Hot Pink\r\nBrown\/Sunflower\r\nBrown\/Sky Blue\r\nPurple\/Antique White\r\nHunter Green\/Antique White\r\nJohnDeere Green\/Sunflower\r\nBlue\/Antique White\r\n\r\nPlease note these signs are not massed produced but each is unique and no two are exactly the same. When working with wood and the antiquing process, each sign has its own warmth and charm. While we try to get the best wood available at the lumber yard, there are going to be some knots and other slight imperfections but that adds to the character of the sign as well as the antiquing process.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by our shop and please do not hesitate to ask any questions..

It creeps up on you. It comes as a whisper from a poem, a novel, or a movie that moved you in a profound way. It comes as a slant of light through a cracked window. It comes as a waft of petrichor in a thirsty desert.\n\nIt comes as a wolf howling on an otherwise silent night. It comes as a longing for a would-be lover\u2019s as-of-yet unfamiliar, and yet somehow achingly familiar, touch. It comes as a glance in a mirror where you can, paraphrasing Jonathan Safran Foer, \u201cfeel your bones straining under the weight of all the lives you\u2019re not living.\u201d\n\nMost of us hear the call in some subtle way. Few of us listen. Even fewer act upon it. Life is all too often a blazingly bright beacon blanketed and smothered by too much comfort, security, and safety.\n\nIt\u2019s there, just under the surface, burning its achingly beautiful truth, waiting for us to lift the veil. Quietly challenging our spirit. Beckoning us to take a leap of courage.\n\nSkeet.\n\nYeet.\n\nRepeat.\n\n~\n\nThis sticker is made of adhesive vinyl and will hold up both indoors and outdoors.

Straight body bottles with high shoulders are recommended for this size of wine label. You want to avoid wine and champagne bottles that have funny shapes or odd textures. To give you a better idea, most Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc bottles will work, as well as champagne bottles similar to the shape of Veuve or Moet Chandon. You also want the body of your bottle to be taller than your custom labels, meaning your bottle should be at least a few inches taller than 4.75 inches.","creation_tsz":1617924668,"ending_tsz":1628465468,"original_creation_tsz":1469395534,"last_modified_tsz":1617924668,"price":"16.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":100,"sku":[],"tags":["wine","label","gift","bride","wedding","maid of honor","wine label","wine bottle label","love","anniversary","live laugh love","laugh","milestones"],"materials":["waterproof paper","label","Live Laugh Love","Happy Anniversary Labels","Custom Wine Labels","Couples Shower Gift","Bridal Shower Gift","Wedding Gift for Bride and Groom","Unique Gift","Party Decor","Printed Self Adhesive Labels","Professionally Printed","Individually Cut printed Wine Labels"],"shop_section_id":19566698,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1568229811,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/454577262\/wine-label-live-laugh-love-style-for?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":148,"num_favorers":8,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1349,"taxonomy_path":["Paper & Party Supplies","Party Supplies","Party Favors & Games","Party Favors"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":962487956,"state":"active","user_id":150945513,"category_id":null,"title":"Distressed Live Laugh Love Engraved Quote Block Sign- Rustic Country Decor","description":"Engraved Wooden Block Sign\n&quot; Live, Laugh, Love&quot;\n\n\nPainted, Distressed Finish \n12&quot; Long 1-3\/4 Tall 3\/4 Thick","creation_tsz":1617924207,"ending_tsz":1628465007,"original_creation_tsz":1615154193,"last_modified_tsz":1617927302,"price":"6.75","currency_code":"USD","quantity":4,"sku":["G1202"],"tags":["Farmhouse","Country","Primitive","Distressed","Quote Block","Inspirational Block","Saying Block","Live","Laugh","love"],"materials":["Wood"],"shop_section_id":28028728,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1615154193,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/962487956\/distressed-live-laugh-love-engraved?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":20,"num_favorers":2,"shipping_template_id":105302142520,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"true","when_made":"2020_2021","item_weight":"12","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"12","item_width":"2","item_height":"2","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2844,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings","Signs"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":672152164,"state":"active","user_id":55030759,"category_id":null,"title":"Live, Laugh,Love Acrylic Table Place Names Personalised Calligraphy Favours","description":"&#39;Live, Laugh, Love&#39;\nHexagonal Clear Acrylic Place Name Settings\n\nThese contemporary and stylish engraved place &#39;cards&#39; will add a very stylish finish to your table, whether for your Wedding or Civil Partnership, a special Birthday meal, or any other seated event.\nThey&#39;re also a great &#39;budget-stretcher&#39; as they&#39;re perfect doubled as your guests&#39; favours.\n\nDetails\nEach name piece measures approx 63 x 55mm \nEngraved with Live, Laugh, Love text and your guest&#39;s name in clear 3mm thick acrylic\nShatterproof and long lasting, our settings are engraved rather than decorated with vinyl or paint.\n\nHow to Order\nSelect the font style you prefer\nPurchase the number of pieces you require\nComplete checkout, then send us an etsy message with details of the names you would like engraved\nPlease send the names in a list (one below the other) and check your spelling carefully as we will engrave each name exactly as it is sent.\nYour order will be cut, engraved and dispatched within 10 working days of payment and personalisation details being received.\n\nWe do not have a limit on the number of letters in names, but may need to alter the font size or layout slightly to accommodate particularly long names.\n\nWe design, cut and engrave or print all of our products here in our South Wales studio.
