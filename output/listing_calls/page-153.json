Straight body bottles with high shoulders are recommended for this size of wine label. You want to avoid wine and champagne bottles that have funny shapes or odd textures. To give you a better idea, most Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc bottles will work, as well as champagne bottles similar to the shape of Veuve or Moet Chandon. You also want the body of your bottle to be taller than your custom labels, meaning your bottle should be at least a few inches taller than 4.75 inches.","creation_tsz":1612033256,"ending_tsz":1622397656,"original_creation_tsz":1471822119,"last_modified_tsz":1612033256,"price":"16.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":99,"sku":[],"tags":["gift","bride","wedding","wine label","wine bottle label","love","anniversary","live laugh love","explore","balloons","clouds","bachelorette","save the date"],"materials":["waterproof paper","label","Happy Anniversary Labels","Live Laugh Love","Wedding Gift for Bride and Groom","Unique Gift","Party Decor","Bridal Shower Gift","Custom Wine Labels","Printed Self Adhesive Labels","Professionally Printed","Individually Cut printed Wine Labels"],"shop_section_id":19566698,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1568229799,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/460319170\/wine-label-hot-air-balloon-love-style?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":141,"num_favorers":16,"shipping_template_id":26411991488,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1349,"taxonomy_path":["Paper & Party Supplies","Party Supplies","Party Favors & Games","Party Favors"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":953090389,"state":"active","user_id":438626797,"category_id":null,"title":"Print -
