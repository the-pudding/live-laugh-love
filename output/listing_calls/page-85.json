The oils in your skin will \u201cclean\u201d the silver and keep it looking shiny.\n\nAvoid exposure: Contact with household chemicals, perspiration, rubber, chlorinated water, or any substances which contain sulfur (e.g., mayonnaise, eggs, mustard, onions, latex, wool), will cause corrosion and tarnish \u2014 so it\u2019s a good idea to remove silver jewelry when doing household chores. Direct sunlight also causes silver to tarnish, so be sure to take off your silver jewelry before you go swimming and sunbathing.\n\nLotions, cosmetics, hair spray and hair products, and perfumes are also \u201cenemies\u201d of silver and will accelerate tarnishing. There\u2019s a reason generations of women have been getting dressed with jewelry last, as a finishing touch!\n\nSTORAGE: As exposure to air tarnishes it, storing silver in airtight plastic bags with anti-tarnish strips is a great preventative measure. Just make sure you don\u2019t store multiple jewelry pieces in the same bag: gold is a soft metal, so the individual pieces can scratch each other. Link or chain bracelets should be kept unclasped or unhooked to prevent scratching as well. If you can\u2019t use plastic bags, try to make sure that the storage area has low humidity. You can also place a piece of chalk, a packet of activated charcoal, or a container of silica gel in the storage area to minimize tarnish.\n\nBracelet Sizes\n\n5.5 to 6.0 Inches (14.0-15.2cm) Small\n6.0-6.5 Inches (15.2 - 16.5cm) Medium\n6.5 - 7.0 Inches (16.5 - 17.8cm) Large\n7.0 to 7.5 Inches (17.8 - 19.0cm) X-Large\n7.5-8.0 inches (19.0 - 20.3cm) 2X-Large\n8.0 - 8.5 Inches (20.3 - 21.6) 3X-Large\n8.5 - 9.0 Inches (21.6 -22.9) 4X-Large\n9.0 - 9.5 Inches (22.9-24.1) 5X-Large\n\nBRACELET Styles and Colors:\n\nGold Adjustable bracelet Lobster Closure\nGold Torpedo and Barrel Closure\nSilver Adjustable Bracelet Lobster Closure\nSilver Torpedo and Barrel Closure","creation_tsz":1617134440,"ending_tsz":1627675240,"original_creation_tsz":1606683172,"last_modified_tsz":1617134440,"price":"29.95","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"sku":["LLL11212020"],"tags":["Bracelet","Charm Bracelet","European Bracelet","Large Hole Beads","Large Hole Bracelet","Chunky Bracelet","Snake Chain Bracelet","Jewelry","Live Love Laugh","Unity","Spirit","Angel Charm","Stainless Steel"],"materials":["Glass","Silver"],"shop_section_id":24472266,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1606683172,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/914501241\/live-love-laugh-unity-spirit-angel?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":5,"num_favorers":2,"shipping_template_id":10893512972,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2020_2021","item_weight":"4","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"8","item_width":"6","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1197,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Bracelets","Charm Bracelets"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":762503451,"state":"active","user_id":255386380,"category_id":null,"title":"Eat Shit Die GTA 5 Large Painting","description":"The perfect painting for any GTA fan who is sick of Karens and their &quot;Live Laugh Love&quot; photos","creation_tsz":1617133207,"ending_tsz":1627674007,"original_creation_tsz":1576429445,"last_modified_tsz":1617133207,"price":"25.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["GTA 5","GTA V","paint","expression","painting","grand theft auto","live laugh love","floral","eat shit die","meme","memes","edgy","grand theft auto V"],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1614288321,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/762503451\/eat-shit-die-gta-5-large-painting?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":298,"num_favorers":27,"shipping_template_id":81956013473,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":false,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":106,"taxonomy_path":["Art & Collectibles","Painting","Acrylic"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":882207777,"state":"active","user_id":292436579,"category_id":null,"title":"I Speak My Mind Because It Hurts To Bite My Tongue Social distance Mixed-Fabric Face Mask cover nose free shipping distancing funny quote","description":"***GIFT WRAPPING IS AVAILABLE FOR ONLY $5 EXTRA!!!

So swapping out existing text - while rest of the design remains as shown in product image. This is free.\nCustomized - adding additional lines of text, border changes, font changes, adding a logo, or any other graphical changes that deviate from the design shown in product image. This is an additional fee (see below for more info on custom orders).\n\n\nPROOFING \nDigital proof is available by request. You must request proof within 24 hours of purchase. We do not provide a proof if you have not yet placed an order. If you need a proof this may delay the above mentioned time. Incomplete information may delay processing time.  If we need to clarify something in your information this may delay the above mentioned time. The time counting begins when we have everything needed to produce your order.   \n\nIf you need to make a change after you have submitted an order and we have not started your order, you will need to cancel your existing order and submit a new order with the desired changes. So please check all of your info before submitting your order.  It is VERY IMPORTANT to double check names\/dates that you submit to us.  Please ensure proper spelling and grammar - customer&#39;s are responsible for any errors submitted with order.  We cannot accept returns or refunds on engraved items, unless we made an error.\n\nYou are given 2 business days to respond to the proof before we move forward with your order in an effort to ship by Etsy&#39;s expected ship date.  \n  \n\nHOW TO ORDER:\nPlease provide your personalization details in the &quot;Notes&quot; section upon checkout: \n\u2022 Couple&#39;s names: In the same order as they should be engraved.\n\u2022 Dates: In the same order as it should be engraved. Please note that the date will be in the same format as in the product picture.  \nIf you wish for them to be case sensitive please state this in your notes otherwise we will use the same case structure in the image of this product. \n\n**IMPORTANT: Beside simple personalization, if you include additional customizations: such as additional lines of text or any other customization that goes beyond simply swapping text that already exists in the product display image - you will delay your order. This would include changing the order of things (date moved from top to bottom, last name removed, etc.) In these cases, we will need to reach out to you for clarification, most likely will require you to purchase a custom fee, and then finally create a proof for your approval. If you have a custom request please see next paragraph.\n\n\nHOW DO I CUSTOMIZE BEYOND WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE PRODUCT LISTING IMAGE?\nIf you are looking to add a logo or graphic, add additional lines of text, change border, or change fonts - then you will need to purchase our $20 custom fee. This would include changing the order of things (date moved from top to bottom, last name removed, etc.). This will also require a proofing step as well. So we would send you a proof image for you to approve (typically the following day after order is place).  \nHOW TO PLACE CUSTOM ORDER: You would first pick the listing that most closely matches your vision and add that to your cart. Next, you would add the custom fee to your cart.\nAdd this to cart ----&gt; https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/StoryCabin\/listing\/499175783\/custom-upcharge\n\n\n\nTo see other &quot;Wedding & Anniversary&quot; designs in my shop, click this link:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/StoryCabin\/search?search_query=Anniversary\n\n\n**GET $5 OFF FIRST ORDER!!**\n---&gt; Use on your first order when you sign up for our email newsletter.

That date cut-off date is subject to change every year.  So check our shop banner in December to see the current cut-off date.  See link below for shop home page.\n\nOur Christmas shipping guarantee covers you in the event your package doesn\u2019t arrive by Dec 24 if you placed your order on or before the cutoff date. We will issue a refund of your shipping fee if you placed your order by cut-off date and it didn&#39;t arrived by Dec 24 for any reason.\n\nWe may also limit our offerings during December to items that are not personalized.  We typically build our inventory in months leading up to Christmas and so to focus on fulfilling those orders we may limit our custom \u201cmade to order\u201d products.\n\n\n-------------------- \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 ----------------------\nThank you for visiting Story Cabin\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/StoryCabin","creation_tsz":1617131054,"ending_tsz":1627671854,"original_creation_tsz":1485488174,"last_modified_tsz":1617131054,"price":"54.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":149,"sku":["C11OAK-WED7","C18OAK-WED7","C18WHT-WED7","C11WHT-WED7","C7OAK-WED7","C7WHT-WED7"],"tags":["wedding","personalized","for couple","clock","wedding gift","modern gift","newly wed gift","modern gift wedding","wedding modern","wedding vintage","wedding retro","wedding classic","live laugh love"],"materials":["wood","oak"],"shop_section_id":20425127,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1614093547,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/494588916\/modern-newly-wed-gift-live-laugh-love?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":362,"num_favorers":12,"shipping_template_id":40344212965,"processing_min":10,"processing_max":15,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"48","item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":"10.75","item_width":"10.75","item_height":"2.5","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1667,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings","Gifts & Mementos","Gifts For The Couple"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":705813600,"state":"active","user_id":36676813,"category_id":null,"title":"Rusty Pickle Commitment Rubber Cling Vinyl Stamp, Acrylic Block, Words & Phrases - RARE","description":"Rare and hard to find.
