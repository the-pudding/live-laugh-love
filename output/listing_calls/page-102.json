What is vinyl wall designs? \r\nA. It is pre-spaced designs made of very thin vinyl. A light adhesive holds each vinyl piece firmly to most hard, smooth surfaces until you&#39;re ready to remove them. Vinyl is flexible, durable and washable. All of our interior vinyl has a matte finish that allows it to blend well with your walls. These vinyl designs are not reusable or movable.\r\n\r\nQ. What surfaces can I apply the designs to? \r\nA. They can be applied to clean, smooth, hard surfaces such as wood, walls, windows, mirrors, doors and even appliances such as fridges and dishwashers. \r\nWe recommend installation to smooth, semi-gloss or gloss enamel paint. If possible, avoid matte finish Latex paints and paints that contain anti-graffiti agents or stain blockers as well as VOC free paints, sand paints and suede paints. \r\nNot recommended for application to unpainted wood, textured walls, stucco, panelling, concrete, brick or over grout lines.\r\nThe decal will take on the same texture as the surface it is placed on. The lettering won&#39;t adhere properly to fabric, rough surfaces, dirty walls, or to paint that isn&#39;t well bonded with the underlying surface. \r\nAllow new paint to dry for at least 3 weeks prior to application of the vinyl. If you would like to test our vinyl on your surface, please message us for a sample.\r\n\r\nQ. How do I apply my wall decor?\r\nA. We will include detailed instructions with each order. It is as easy as applying a large sticker to your wall.\r\n\r\nQ. Can I reuse the lettering? \r\nA. No. The lettering is extremely thin and tends to stretch as it is being removed. Each decal is good for a one time use.\r\n\r\nQ. Can it be used in rooms with high humidity like bathrooms?\r\nA. Humidity doesn&#39;t affect the performance of the lettering. It works very well in bathrooms. Make sure that the surface you transfer your image to is dry and clean. \r\n\r\nQ. Can I use the designs outdoors? \r\nA. Yes. Avoid attempting to apply the vinyl in freezing conditions as the vinyl will not adhere. Also be sure that the surface is clean, dry, hard, smooth and flat. \r\n\r\nQ. Does it work on tile? \r\nA. It performs very well on tile. However, it won&#39;t work well over grout lines. \r\n\r\nQ. I got air bubbles in my decal when applying it?\r\nA.The best way to remove little bubbles that don&#39;t press out under your vinyl, is by using a little straight pin or safety pin. Just poke a little hole, and press it smooth. \r\n\r\nQ. How do I clean my design? \r\nA. Use a mild household cleaner, a soft cloth or sponge, and a light touch. Avoid cleaners that contain alcohol or abrasives. \r\n\r\nQ.
