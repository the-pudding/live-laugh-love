Please check with everyone in your household as someone else might have brought it in. Sometimes we have heard of a package going to a neighbor mistakenly or being left at a different\/side door. In our experience, usually the package is located.\nMost orders are shipped via UPS Mail Innovations or UPS Surepost, and final delivery is by the USPS so we also suggest having the customer contact their local post office and many times they can get in touch with the actual person who delivered it and see if they recall where they left it. It\u2019s best to do that soon after it\u2019s marked as delivered.\n\ud83d\udc95 NO TRACKING OR NO MOVEMENT\nIf a package does not show any movement and has passed the allotted time for delivery we will send a new package at our cost to the customer.
