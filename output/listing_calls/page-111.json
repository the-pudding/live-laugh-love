Everyone suffers periods of depression sometime during their lives.  For some, the down times are short-lived, for others...it takes years before there is any relief.\n\nThis small manual is a suggestion guide that will help you get through some difficult times.  I wrote this little book from my own experiences.\n\nA combination of these tips will hopefully bring some relief.\n\nTaking care of yourself is a life-long process.  The road to success has its obstacles, so don\u2019t ever give up.\n\nI wish you Peace, Hope and Love Always.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEsther G. Monsalve\nThe Angel Shop\n\n\nUpdate: October 7th, 2017\n\nP.S.  Life is good\u2026and then it gets better...and then...the best is yet to come.\n\nDear Reader, \n\nPlease see a physician and\/or healthcare professional BEFORE you try any of the suggestions listed.\n\nDoctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, school counselors who have the medical training, knowledge, formal education, experience, practice and above all...the sincere desire to help, support, care and love those in true need of healthy healing\/living... please listen to them and follow their medical advice\/prescriptions.  \n\nAgain...all of us have a purpose in life...and...taking good care of yourself is a life-long process.  Don&#39;t ever give up...no matter what. \n\nAnd, imagine in your mind to tell that inner\/outer critic to go sit in the corner or side or hiding behind a desk of the room to just be quiet.\n\nThank you.\n\nEsther Monsalve\nThe Angel Shop\n\nHelpful Tips to Beat the Down Times\n\nGET HELP \u2013 Call or visit a friend, relative, therapist or doctor.  Talking things out will relieve some of the suppressed anger or grief.  Your doctor might prescribe medication.  If so, follow his\/her directions.  The numerous anti-depressants available now-a-days work wonders.\n\nGET UP AND DO SOMETHING \u2013 Many people don\u2019t want to do anything when they are depressed.  They don\u2019t have the strength or desire to go out and be active.  This is an important time to take a walk (exercise will benefit you tremendously) and\/or do some writing.\n\nTake a nice warm bath with soothing music in the background.\n\nTreat yourself to your favorite snack or meal.\n\nGo outside or to the park and get some fresh air.  Take a moment and listen to the birds and wind (or traffic if you live in the city).  Take a deep breath and remind yourself that you will get through these difficult times.\n\nWRITE -  Get a blank notebook or journal and write your thoughts and feelings.  If you don\u2019t know what to say, doodle or draw.  Spend at least 25 minutes or longer writing.  Read it later.  Keeping a journal is an interesting way of expressing your feelings.  You don\u2019t have to show the journal to anyone.\n\nMAKE EXTRA MONEY -  If you like to make extra money, clean out your closets or garage.  Rent a booth at the local flea market and sell your unwanted items...these days, many internet websites can be another source of generating a few dollars.\n\nYou will meet people, make money and be doing something.  \u201cOne man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u201d  If you can make things, such as jewelry, stichery, candles or create art, selling your work is definetly a spirit lifter.\n\nPRAY -  For those of you who believe in God, prayer is powerful.  It brings peace, hope and comfort.  Be patient and continue to ask for help.  In my opinion, you don\u2019t have to go to church.  God is everywhere.  If you wish, read positive literature or listen to inspirational music. Always remember that God loves you.  Keep a reminder in your pocket or purse.\n\nGIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO CRY \u2013 It is OK to release your emotions.  Express your feelings in a safe way and in a safe place\u2026.example: scream into a pillow, punch it or throw it across the room.\n\nSEE A THERAPIST \u2013 Regular visits to a licensed professional who will support and help sort out your feelings is another tool to relieving depression.  They can give you many tools to help you get through your depression as well as provide insight and healthy options to help resolve your past and present issues.\n\nIF POSSIBLE, GET A PET \u2013 A dog or cat gives unconditional love and he or she needs you just as much.  Studies show that owning a dog or cat reduces stress and\u2026.they are great, loyal companions.\n\nGO TO THE LIBRARY \u2013 Read positive self-help books.  I recommend the book Feeling Good by David Burns and When I Say No, I Feel Guilty by Manuel J. Smith.  Research depression and its different types.  You will learn a great deal.\n\nTALK TO YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR -  Some people find this odd but if you say positive things to yourself such as \u201cYou will be all right.\u201d  \u201cYou are a wonderful person; hang in there\u201d.  \u201cI like you and I care what happens to you\u201d, you will feel a difference.\n\nNO ALCOHOL OR DRUGS -  Alcohol and\/or drugs will bring temporary gratification, but that is NOT the answer.  It will only hurt you.  Please stay away from drugs and alcohol.\n\nMAKE A WISH LIST -  Write down all the things you wish to do in life.  List the ones that sound reasonable and even those that might be impossible.  Make a promise to work on the ones that are attainable...for example:  Go back to school.  Change your career.  Exercise more.  Get your financial status up to date.  Find a new job.  Work on your relationships.  Take time out for yourself.\n\nTAKE AN INFORMAL CLASS -   Your local college or University offers a variety of classes for those who wish to learn something new.  Take a class in creative writing, in arts and crafts or learn how to play the guitar.  A computer class will enhance your skills at work and at home.  A basic automotive class is extremely beneficial too.\n\nSWIM, PLAY POOL OR GO TO A CONCERT -  Get out and have some fun.\n\nRENT A Movie \u2013 Comedies are my favorites.  They get me laughing again.  Try it.\n\nVOLUNTEER -  Help those who are less fortunate.  There are many centers that need your support\u2026.the homeless, an abused children&#39;s center, disabled individuals and the elderly.  Take time a few hours a week volunteering your assistance.\n\n  DO SOMETHING YOU\u2019VE NEVER DONE BEFORE -   Is there something in your life you have never done but always wanted to do?  Then...I suggest to try it.  I started selling my creative writing and arts and crafts at the flea market.  This boosted my self-esteem and brought me a little extra cash.  I also went camping with my daughter for the first time at age 40.  I loved it!\n\nFollow your dreams.    \n\nEsther Monsalve\nThe Angel Shop\n\nNote: Please use MEMO, an editor writing software, in oder to open this digital file.","creation_tsz":1613217625,"ending_tsz":1623582025,"original_creation_tsz":1376252874,"last_modified_tsz":1613217625,"price":"0.20","currency_code":"USD","quantity":977,"sku":[],"tags":["depression","feeling better","exercise","care for yourself","don't give up","life is good","hope","love","be true to yourself","live love laugh","the angel shop","The Power of Love","peace"],"materials":["suggestions"],"shop_section_id":11054080,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1603342062,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/159352073\/how-to-get-thru-depression-update?utm_source=thepuddinglistingima&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":313,"num_favorers":33,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2019","item_weight":null,"item_weight_unit":"oz","item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":true,"file_data":"1 DOC","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1139,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Spirituality & Religion","Meditation"],"used_manufacturer":false,"is_vintage":false},{"listing_id":839034584,"state":"active","user_id":222755140,"category_id":null,"title":"Live Laugh Love inspirational quote Wall Sticker transfer Decal Bedroom Vinyl Modern Decor gift v102","description":"\u2663\ufe0e Dimensions \u2663\ufe0e\n\nApproximately 80cm wide x 55cm high or 30cm wide x 20cm high\n\nA beautiful inspirational quote themed personalised wall sticker \n\nMaterial: Machine cut vinyl, manufactured in the UK\nDurability: 10+ years indoor lifetime expectancy\nDelivery: within 3 working days\n\nAll of our designs are packaged with care and sent in a heavy duty postal tube ensuring that the print arrives in perfect condition.\n\n\u2663\ufe0ePROCESSING AND SHIPPING\u2663\ufe0e\nEach design is made to order!

Follow the steps and instructions below to achieve perfect results on your next project!\n \n1) No Teflon Sheets, Covers or Pillows. Ever. Never use teflon sheets, covers or pillows with any of our plastisol formulas. They dissipate the heat too much, resulting in a poorly applied transfer.\n \n2) Calibrate Your Heat Press. You will need to use a quality Infrared (IR) Temperature Gun (Contactless) to ensure your heat press is heating evenly and accurately. You should do this each and every time you start a new pressing cycle.\n \n3) Pressure, Pressure, Pressure. Plastisol transfers will give you a quality and long-lasting decoration solution, but you HAVE to ensure you are using adequate and even pressure. This will ensure the formula properly adheres to your garment. Not using enough pressure can result in poorly applied plastisol transfers.\n \n4) Water resistant, waterproof, and fireproof garments: We recommend testing a sample on your item before production.
